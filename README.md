# PasswordGenerator
This is a simple password generator I am writing in java to practice coding, also just for fun. It runs on the command line and can be used to create secure passwords given that the passwords it generates are generated pseudo-randomly. You can choose if you want to have upper case letters, lower case letters, symbols, and numbers. I will continue to add more features overtime to try to make it as user friendly and useful as possible. Also if you choose to use this I recommend writing the
passwords down somewhere or adding them to your password manager, because your passwords that are generated are not saved anywhere.

To run,
You must have java installed (Version: Java SE17). As of right now you need to compile the code from source yourself.
Clone git repository or copy src folder however you see fit.
In powershell navigate to the directory you installed the project to and run **javac com\UserInputHandler.java com\passwdGen.java com\passwdGenMain.java**. 
Then run **java com.passwdGenMain**.
